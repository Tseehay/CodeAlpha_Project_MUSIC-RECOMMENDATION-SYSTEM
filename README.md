# MUSIC RECOMMDATION SYSTEM

Spotify's recommendation system, powered by machine
learning, predicts a user's likelihood of repeatedly listening to a
song within a set timeframe. Using a dataset with 1 indicating
repeated plays within a month, it tracks user song histories and
timestamps to generate personalized song recommendations.
